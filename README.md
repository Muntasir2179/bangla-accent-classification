# App Description
This is an web application that is built using Django and Node.js framework. This application requires dual server, the audio denoising has been done using
Node.js and the for the users requests handling we have used Django.

## Working Principle
This is an AI powered application that uses trained deep learning models to predict Accent from people's voice. People can put their voice in and the the
application will use it's denoising capabilities to make the sound clear and then it passes that audio data to the model. The model then predicts the 
accent class and sends the response back to the user.
