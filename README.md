# Bangla Accent Classification
Accent classification is a crucial task in natural language processing that automatically identifies the accent class expressed in voice. 
This project focuses on utilizing deep learning techniques to perform accent classification and explore the effectiveness of various algorithms in accurately predicting accents.

## Dataset Details
We have collected a total of 370 voice samples for seven accents. As regular voice recordings contain various noises thus, we have cleaned audio clips with AI Audio Denoising tools.

## Models Performance
We have built Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and trained it with the audio features. We have got 92.23% of maximum training accuracy and 87.84% of maximum validation accuracy. Then we fitted the same features into an
LSTM network and we got 90.88% of maximum training accuracy and 70.27% of maximum validation accuracy.
